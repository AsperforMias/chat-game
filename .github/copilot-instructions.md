This is a simple AI-powered RPG exploration game project. 

## Core Design Principles
- Keep the code simple and readable
- Focus on AI character interactions and world exploration
- Avoid unnecessary complexity
- Use clean, minimal architecture
- AI characters should respond dynamically using configurable API keys

## Project Structure
- `main.py` - Entry point and game loop
- `world.py` - World and location management
- `character.py` - AI character system
- `ai_service.py` - AI API integration
- `config.py` - Configuration management
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies

## Code Style
- Use clear, descriptive function and variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add docstrings to classes and functions
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use type hints where appropriate
